<div> <span>This is a song
For the ladies,
But fella's,
Listen closely.</span>
<span>You don't always have to fuck her hard
In fact sometimes that's not right to do
Sometimes you got to make some love
And fuckin' give her some smooches too</span></div>
<div><span>Sometimes you've got to squeeze
Sometimes you've got to say please
Sometimes you got to say hey
I'm gonna fuck you, softly
I'm gonna screw you gently
I'm gonna hump you, sweetly
I'm gonna ball you discreetly
And then you say hey I brought you flowers
And then you say wait a minute Sally
I think I've got something in my teeth
Could you get it out for me
That's fuckin' teamwork
What's your favorite posish
That's cool with me it's not my favorite but I'll do it for you
What's your favorite dish
I'm not gonna cook it, but I'll order it from zanzibar
And then I'm gonna love you completely
And then I'll fucking fuck you discreetly
And then I'll fucking bone you completely
But then
I'm gonna fuck you hard
Hard</span></div>
